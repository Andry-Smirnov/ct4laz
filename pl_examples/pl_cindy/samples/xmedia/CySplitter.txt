The TcySplitter component

Splitter component that can be used like TSplitter. 
You can also resize its parent and define the side to be resized with ResizeSide property. 

So, why another Splitter component?
- Because some controls like TCategoryPanelGroup (Delphi 2009) don't accept components between panels and i want to resize each TCategoryPanels with a splitter component aligned to bottom. Just put a TcySplitter component aligned to bottom on each TCategoryPanel and set ResizeSide property to rmParent.
- TcySplitter doesn' t need to be aligned on ResizeMode = rmParent.
- You can specify ResizeSide property to manually define splitter job.
- Visual features added: Bevels, Gradient, hot and grip.
- You can define handled control with OnDetermineHandledControl event.
